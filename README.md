# Detecting license plates using LiDAR information for light intensity.

In this project, the possibility of detecting the position of license plate in an image is evaluated based on the reflection information obtained by Lidar dataset. The KITTI dataset is used for training, validating and testing the model. The detections made using LiDAR information are then compared with detections made using normal camera information. The Colab_Notebook contains more information about the process. Below are some successful detections run by the custom trained model and the refrences that helped achieve this task.
